# CS 441 Homework 3 : Implementation of Chord algorithm using Akka Simulations.

## Overview
The Homework aims to make simulations to demonstrate working of Cloud Simulator using Chord Algorithm, for the implementation we are using Akka which is a
open source toolkit for designing scalable, resilient systems that span processor cores and networks.

### Project Members

- Aishwarya Sahani
- Ansul Goenka
- Gautamkumar Ojha
- Mihir Kelkar


### Instructions to run the simulations
1. Clone the project - ```git clone https://ojhagautam97@bitbucket.org/cs441-fall2020/group_6.git```
2. Navigate to the project folder - cd group_6/
3. Run the simulations with the command : ```sbt clean compile run```
4. Run the test cases using the command : ```sbt clean compile test```
5. Open the link generated by the WebService at ```http://localhost:8080/```


### Homework Files 

- WebService 
    - This is the entry point for our homework, this scala file uses Akka-HTTP library for making routes for different options to run the simulations 
    by calling methods for required simulation task.
    - After running this object file you get a link ```http://localhost:8080/``` which will redirect to the webpage with 4 buttons:
        - Add Node : Clicking this button calls method createServerNode() which adds node.
        - Load Data : Clicking this button calls method loadData(id.toInt) which loads the result in the form of string in the server. To load data append ?id=<any integer> to your link.
        - Lookup Data : Clicking this button calls method getData(id.toInt) which is used by the user to look data over a server node using Chord Protocol. To look-up data append ?id=<any integer> to your link.
        - Snapshot : Clicking this button simply returns all the result for the simulation.
