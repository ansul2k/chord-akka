# CS 441 Homework 3 : Implementation of Chord algorithm using Akka Simulations.

## Overview
The Homework aims to make simulations to demonstrate working of Cloud Simulator using Chord Algorithm, for the implementation we are using Akka which is a
open source toolkit for designing scalable, resilient systems that span processor cores and networks.

- Mihir Kelkar


### Instructions to run the simulations
1. Clone the project - ```git clone https://ojhagautam97@bitbucket.org/cs441-fall2020/group_6.git```
2. Navigate to the project folder - cd group_6/
3. Run the simulations with the command : ```sbt clean compile run```
4. Run the test cases using the command : ```sbt clean compile test```
5. Open the link generated by the WebService at ```http://localhost:8080/```


### Homework Files 

- WebService 
    - This is the entry point for our homework, this scala file uses Akka-HTTP library for making routes for different options to run the simulations 
    by calling methods for required simulation task.
    - After running this object file you get a link ```http://localhost:8080/``` which will redirect to the webpage with 4 buttons:
        - Add Node : Clicking this button calls method createServerNode() which adds node.
        - Load Data : Clicking this button calls method loadData(id.toInt) which loads the result in the form of string in the server. To load data append ?id=<any integer> to your link.
        - Lookup Data : Clicking this button calls method getData(id.toInt) which is used by the user to look data over a server node using Chord Protocol. To look-up data append ?id=<any integer> to your link.
        - Snapshot : Clicking this button simply returns all the result for the simulation.
        
- ActorDriver
    - This object file defines the number of users, servers, ActorSystem, Actors (serverActor, userActor, supervisorActor).
    - It also defines methods used by Webservices and defined in the actor class files to load data, lookup data and display the result.

-  ServerActor
    - This class file represents actor-server which implements chord algorithm and defines messages as follows:
        - case initializeFirstFingerTable(nodeIndex: Int) : It initializes the first finger table for the first server-node.
        - case initializeFingerTable(nodeIndex: Int) : It initializes the finger table for all the server nodes after the first one.
        - case updateOthers(nodeIndex: Int) : It updates all nodes whose finger table should refer to the new node which joins the network.
        - case updateTable(predecessorValue:Int, nodeIndex: Int, i: Int) : It is invoked by updateOthers which recursively updates finger-table.
        - case updatePredecessor(nodeIndex: Int) : This case class updates the predecessor.
        - case getSuccessor() : Returns the successor of the given entry.
        - case getDataServer(id: Int, m: Int, hash: Int) : Returns output when looked-up is performed. 
    - Also, the class defines following methods :
        - getData(id: Int, m: Int, hash: Int) : Returns result in the form of string when invoked by getDataServer(id: Int, m: Int, hash: Int).
        - findSuccessor(nodeIndex: Int) : Returns successor value for the given node by fetching successor value for an arbitrary node and eventually updating the successor value for the given node.
        - findPredecessor(nodeIndex: Int) : Returns predecessor value for the given node by invoking another method closestPrecedingFinger(nodeIndex: Int) which returns finger table value for the given node.
        - belongs(s:Int, n: Int, successorValue: Int) : Invoked by updateTable() to check whether the node belongs within the range of predecessor and fingerIthEntry value.
        
- UserActor
    - This class file represents actor-user and defines messages as follows:
        - case class loadData(data:EntityDefinition) : Returns result of the loaded data from the server to the user.
        - case getDataUserActor(id) : Returns result by looking up data from the server.
        - case createUserActor(id) : Returns path of created user actor.
- SupervisorActor 
    - This class acts as a bridge between user and the server actor. The user actor invokes the messages defined in this class which returns results by invoking messages defined in the ServerActor.
